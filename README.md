# Medical Speech Recognition Enhancement using Domain-Specific Models

In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to a remarkable emphasis on speech recognition technology. This technology has become increasingly refined, finding applications in various practical fields such as smart speakers, voice customer service, and online voice interviews. The transformative potential of speech recognition has been harnessed to enhance work efficiency and elevate overall quality of life.

## Background

Despite the significant progress in speech recognition, there has been a notable gap in research concerning its optimization for domain-specific applications, particularly in the medical field. Previous investigations have demonstrated that utilizing general-purpose speech recognition models for specialized domains yields suboptimal results. This study addresses this gap by focusing on enhancing speech recognition models and optimizing error correction specifically for medical scenarios.

## Objective

The primary goal of this study is to develop and refine speech recognition models to enhance their performance within the medical domain. We have undertaken a multi-faceted approach that involves leveraging medical datasets, optimizing language models, and employing advanced architectures for error correction.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** The PubMed and MedDialog medical datasets were utilized for training and evaluation purposes. The PubMed dataset was initially employed to optimize the speech recognition language model and dictionary.

2. **Model Enhancement:** The optimized language model was subjected to error correction using three distinct model architectures: Bert2Bert, BioBert2BioBert, and BART.

3. **Robustness Testing:** To ensure the reliability of the developed model, it was rigorously tested using out-of-domain data from the MedDialog dataset.

## Results

The proposed methodology exhibited promising results, showcasing improved speech recognition accuracy and error correction within the medical domain. The model demonstrated robustness when tested on diverse medical scenarios, highlighting its potential for enhancing efficiency in various medical applications, including medical consultations.

## Future Directions

This research sets the stage for future advancements in medical speech recognition technology. The developed model architecture holds promise for broader implementation within the medical domain, offering substantial benefits in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and quality of interactions. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, this work opens doors to more sophisticated and tailored speech recognition solutions for medical professionals and patients alike.
